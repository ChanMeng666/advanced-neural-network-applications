The purpose of this is to reduce the amount of tuning required for the model to achieve similar performance over a limited number of training cycles ($epochs = 3000$).\n",
    "### Step 3: Adjust the learning rate and the learning rate decay strategy \n",
    "In order to quickly approximate the target equation within a limited number of training cycles, I can adjust the learning rate and its decay strategy appropriately. A higher initial learning rate will allow us to quickly approach the target value at the beginning of the training period, while an appropriate decay will reduce the excessive oscillations when approaching the target and maintain the stability of the training. Set `learning_rate = 0.01` (higher initial learning rate) and `learning_rate_decay = 0.9995` (mild decay).\n",
    "### Step 4: Training in a finite number of cycles \n",
    "Using the initial weights, bias and learning rate configurations set above, the model is trained in a finite number of $epochs = 3000$ cycles. This phase of training still uses the gradient descent algorithm, but since the starting point is closer to the final target, the model will be able to achieve higher accuracy in a shorter period of time."
